  <b>DIGITAL SEX LIFE</b> is a generative simulation where numbers come alive as male and female digits, moving, bonding, aging, and reproducing in a playful, evolving ecosystem. Inspired by my early fascination with Tarot and numerology, the project was first coded in BASIC on a Commodore Amiga back in 1991, while I was an apprentice at ZKM (Center for Art and Media in  Karlsruhe, Germany), using a touchscreen interface to explore numeric relationships and emergent behavior.

  Over the years, I have re-coded it multiple times in HTML/CSS/JavaScript as web technologies evolved. The current version remains true to the original concept but incorporates refinements that were made easier with the assistance of AI coding tools, using color, scale, motion, and dynamic statistics to visualize life cycles, attraction, and generational patternsâ€”inviting viewers to reflect on how simple numeric rules give rise to complex, lifelike dynamics and abstract explorations of intimacy and connection.
